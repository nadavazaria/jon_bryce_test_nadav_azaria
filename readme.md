# jon bryce test 1
    we were required to implement a number of functions in different files
    file test
        readme 
        requirements.txt
        env
        test.py
            this program checks the functions built in the nested files
        file tools 
            1. col.py 
                implements a zip like function for collections and a zip1 function for lists

            file numbers
                simp.py
                    1. add_2_nums - does simple addition
                    2. sub_2_nums - does simple substraction
                comp.py
                    these functions work only if we used one of the simp functions else prints error
                    1.is_pal - checks if a number is a palindrom
                    2.sum_digits - returns the sim of the digits of input number
